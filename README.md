Mikrotik chr auto install Ubuntu vps -- version 18 or 20.4

curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asghar61/main/install.sh | sudo bash




shutdown manually from vps ui, then turn on it



Caution !!!
I already test anything to set password on boot, but it can't. so after vps turn on, you must be change the password and user. otherwise you know what will happen :)
